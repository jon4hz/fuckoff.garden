                <p>I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an Emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer
                    anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to
                    help one another. Human beings are like that.
                </p>

                <p>We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and
                    despise one another.
                    In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone.
                    The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</p>

                <p>Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery
                    and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives
                    abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We
                    think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we
                    need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.
                </p>

                <p>The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
                    The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal
                    brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world:
                    millions of despairing men, women, and little children; victims of a system that makes men torture
                    and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say "Do not despair."</p>

                <p>The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of
                    human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people
                    will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.</p>

                <p>Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives,
                    tell you what to do, what to think, and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like
                    cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with
                    machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men.
                    You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and
                    the unnatural. Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.</p>

                <p>In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written “The kingdom of God is within man.” Not one
                    man, nor a group of men, but in all men. In you, you the people have the power, the power to create
                    machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and
                    beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that
                    power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to
                    work that will give youth a future and old age a security.</p>

                <p>By the promise of these things brutes have risen to power, but they lie, they do not fulfill their
                    promise. They never will. Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people. Now let us fight
                    to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world. To do away with national barriers, to do
                    away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where
                    science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.</p>

                <p>Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!</p>

                <p>Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the
                    darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world a kind new world where men will rise above
                    their hate and brutality. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last, he is beginning to fly.
                    He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future. That glorious future that
                    belongs to you, to me and to all of us.
                    Look up! Look up.</p>
